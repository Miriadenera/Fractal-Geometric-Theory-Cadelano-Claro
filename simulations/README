# Simulations

This folder contains scripts and configuration files related to the computational simulations of the Fractal Geometric Theory – Unified Framework.

## Included Simulations

- **Gradient dynamics** of the informational field ∇𝒦 over a discrete lattice
- **5D N-body problem** under Higgs–torsion geometry (setup file included)

## Structure

- `gradient_dynamics.py` – Main Python script simulating ∇𝒦 evolution
- `config_nbody.json` – Initial conditions for N-body simulations in 5D
